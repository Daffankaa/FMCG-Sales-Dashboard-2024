# FMCG-Sales-Dashboard-2024

FMCG Sales Dashboard tracks each transaction stage within the business: Sell-In (from principal to distributor), Sell-Through (from distributor to store), and Sell-Out (from store to end-user), alongside income generated. This dashboard provides SKU-level data granularity, segmented by date and store, for an in-depth view of sales performance.

## Project Overview
This project integrates data from multiple sources to provide a unified and interactive sales performance dashboard using Power BI. The goal is to enable a complete analysis of FMCG sales data, covering the entire transaction journey.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Power BI dashboards enable dynamic filtering, drill-downs, and trend analysis, providing actionable insights on sales trends, revenue, and performance across all transaction stages.
- **Data Integration**: Combines data from 10 SQL Server tables with MongoDB Sell-Out data to form a comprehensive dataset, covering all business transaction stages in a single view.
- **ETL Process**: Python scripts automate data extraction and loading from SQL Server and MongoDB into Google BigQuery, ensuring data consistency and reducing manual work.
- **Data Warehouse**: Google BigQuery serves as the primary OLAP structure, acting as the centralized source for analytics and reporting across teams.

## Technical Details
- **Tools Used**: Power BI for visualization, SQL for data integration, Python for ETL, Google BigQuery as the data warehouse, and SQL Server and MongoDB as data sources.
- **Data Sources and Integration**: Data is sourced from SQL Server (transactional data) and MongoDB (Sell-Out data). SQL and MongoDB queries unify data across 10 tables and collections, transforming it into a single analytical dataset.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Python automates the data extraction, transformation, and load processes, transferring data to Google BigQuery and preparing it for OLAP analysis.
- **OLAP Structure**: Google BigQuery is structured as a data warehouse for fast querying and large-scale data processing, enabling complex aggregations and multi-dimensional analysis.
